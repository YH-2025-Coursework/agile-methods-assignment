## Project Context

This is a school assignment where the focus is on **agile workflow and teamwork**, not production-quality code. The webshop is non-functional (no actual checkout processing) and serves as a vehicle for practicing:

- Feature branch workflow
- GitHub Issues and Projects (Kanban board)
- Pull requests and code review
- Team collaboration using Discord and VS Code
