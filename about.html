    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>
        Monster Reads is an online book shop dedicated to classic literature
        with dark and thought-provoking themes.
    </p>

    <p>
        We sell <strong>Frankenstein</strong> because it is a timeless story
        about creation, responsibility, and the consequences of ambition.
    </p>

    <p>
        The shop is run by a small fictional team of book lovers who are
        passionate about classic monster stories.
